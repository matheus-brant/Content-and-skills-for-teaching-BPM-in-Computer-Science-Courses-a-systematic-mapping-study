This repository serves as a valuable resource for academics, professionals and organizations interested in teaching BPM, providing access to detailed data and results from the conducted Systematic Literature Review.

# Systematic Literature Review on BPM Teaching

## Objectives
This repository houses the artifacts and documents generated during the conduct of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) with the purpose of understanding the contents and competencies covered in Business Process Management (BPM) education. The outlined specific objectives were:

1. Obtain an overview of the main contents and identify new proposals for BPM education.
2. Identify competencies addressed for students' development in BPM.
3. Understand the teaching methods used in BPM, aiming to enhance knowledge transmission.
4. Investigate the technologies and tools supporting BPM education, comprehending their impact on the learning process.
5. Evaluate the main challenges in BPM professionals' training identified after the start of their careers.

## Systematic Literature Review
The SLR followed the guidelines established by Kitchenham and Charters (2007), as detailed in Figure 1. Motivated by the need to understand the requirements for effective BPM teaching, this review provides valuable insights both in the academic context, driving curricular and methodological improvements, and in the market, aligning training programs with identified demands and trends.

## Research Questions
The SLR planning included the specification of the following Research Questions:

- **MRQ: What are the contents and competencies needed to promote BPM teaching?**
  - **SRQ1:** What are the main contents covered in BPM teaching?
  - **SRQ2:** What are the main competencies developed in BPM teaching?
  - **SRQ3:** What are the teaching methods to convey BPM knowledge?
  - **SRQ4:** How do technologies support BPM teaching?
  - **SRQ5:** What are the main challenges in BPM professionals' training?

## Data Collection and Synthesis
To ensure transparency and replicability, we developed a data collection form and a spreadsheet synthesizing information from primary studies. We adopted quality criteria and scores, facilitating the synthesis of results. The color legend indicates approval or rejection at each stage of the process.

## Repository Content
1. List of articles, books, and documents used as references.
2. Spreadsheet with the SLR planning.
3. Spreadsheet of primary studies, qualified articles, data collection form, tables, and graphs with data synthesis.
4. Full study article.

For replicability, we included [links](#) where the data is available, promoting transparency in the research.
